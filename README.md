mini (toy) c compiler based on nora sandler's book

## About

Based on [this blog series by Nora Sandler: Write a Compiler](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html), more specifically the full [book](https://norasandler.com/book/)

Also check out my first version based on the blog only: [mcc](https://github.com/rumkugel13/mcc)

The current goal is to output assembly for the following ISA's:

- x86_64 (or just x64)
- aarch64 (or arm64)
- riscv64
